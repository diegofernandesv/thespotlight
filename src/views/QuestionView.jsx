    question: "What's more important: protecting bees or ensuring high crop yields and stable food prices?",
    choices: ["Protecting bees", "Productivity"],
    fact: "Bees and other pollinators are essential for 75% of global food crops, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and coffee. Without them, yields drop, prices rise, and food diversity decline, threatening ecosystems, farmersâ€™ livelihoods, and global food security.",

    question: "Your country bans plastic straws and builds wind turbines. But in other places, like India, pollution is rising fast. Does making all this effort still feel meaningful to you?",
    choices: [
      "Yes â€” progress has to start somewhere.",
      "No â€” it feels like weâ€™re fixing a leak in a sinking ship",

    fact: "Denmark cut emissions by 40% since 1990 and now gets over 50% of electricity from wind. Artificial lights are causing birds and insects to disappear.Your street is brightly lit for safety and comfort.Would you vote to make your neighborhood darker?Indiaâ€™s total emissions rise, but per person they emit 75% less than Denmark. Wealthy countries still lead in per-capita impact",

    ],
    fact: "Artificial light at night disrupts migration, feeding, and reproduction in birds, insects, and bats. Insects attracted to lights die in large numbers. Studies show street lighting contributes to biodiversity loss â€” but reducing it can raise safety concerns.",

      "Built it anyway",

    ],
    fact: "European hedgehog populations have dropped by up to 70% in some regions over 20 years. Roads are a key factor â€” not just due to roadkill, but because they split up habitats, isolate populations, and block access to food and mates.",

    question: "To reduce carbon emissions, Denmark covers large open areas with wind turbines â€” but this drives away rare birds and disrupts their migration.Would you rather :",
    choices: [
      "Prioritize clean energy",
      "Protect untouched bird habitats",
    ],
    fact: "Wind power supplies over 50% of Denmarkâ€™s electricity. However, studies show that turbines can displace bird species like the sea eagle and reduce breeding success near wind farms. Placement and design play a key role in reducing impacts.",
